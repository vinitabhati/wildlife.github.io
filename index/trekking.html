<h1>Pangong Tso inladakh  </h1>

        Pangong Tso is in disputed territory. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) passes through the lake. A section of the lake approximately 20 km east from the LAC is controlled by China but claimed by India. The eastern end of the lake is in Tibet. After the mid-19th century, Pangong Tso was at the southern end of Johnson Line, an early attempt at demarcation between India and China in the Aksai Chin region.

        The Khurnak Fort lies on the northern bank of the lake, about halfway of Pangong Tso. The Chinese has controlled the Khurnak Fort area since 1958.[15] To the south is the smaller Spanggur Tso lake.
        
        On 20 October 1962, Pangong Tso saw military action during the Sino-Indian War, successful for the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).[16] The area remains a sensitive border point along the LAC.[17][18] Incursions from the Chinese side are common.[19]
